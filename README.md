- **Database**:
  - Uses **PostgreSQL** for robust data storage.
  - Managed with **Prisma** for type-safe database access.

- **Authentication**:
  - Secure user authentication using **NextAuth.js**.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Built with a mobile-first approach for seamless use on all devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher) for local development.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rentality.git
   cd rentality
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

     ```plaintext
     # Google OAuth Credentials
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

     # Database Connection URL
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name

     # NextAuth.js Configuration
     NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
     NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth

     # Google Maps API Key
     NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key

     # Base URL for the Application
     BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

3. **Start the application with Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Start a PostgreSQL database.
   - Build and run the Next.js application.

4. **Access the application**:

   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - PostgreSQL: `http://localhost:5432` (if needed)

---

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the PostgreSQL database**:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally or update the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to point to your database.

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Docker Setup

This project includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy containerization and deployment. The setup includes:

- **PostgreSQL**: Database service.
- **Frontend**: Next.js application.

To start the services:

```bash
